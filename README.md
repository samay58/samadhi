# Samadhi

*music in stride*

Samadhi is a native iPhone music experience that lets a runner's cadence and music settle into one rhythm. The current build proves complete interaction and now includes the source-neutral Milestone 2 policy, cadence boundary, Core Motion adapter, and a focused Apple Music device harness. Production music and physical cadence remain unproven.

## Current state

Milestones 0 and 1 are complete. Milestone 2 is in progress. The source-neutral adaptation and cadence groundwork is built. Exact-App-ID signing fixed Apple catalog access. Authorization, 40-playlist loading, strict catalog resolution, 10 of 10 local preview decodes, real playback, rate writes, pause, and resume now pass on an iPhone 17 Pro. Spotify is rejected for adaptive playback. Apple Music still needs headphone listening, background, track-change, interruption, and route-recovery proof before it becomes the production source.

Start with [product ethos](Docs/PRODUCT.md), then read [current status](Docs/STATUS.md), [next plan](Docs/PLAN.md), the [Milestone 2 specification](Docs/MILESTONE-2-SPEC.md), and the active [music-source resolution specification](Docs/MUSIC-SOURCE-RESOLUTION-SPEC.md).
