# Verification

## Full gate

~~~sh
./Scripts/bootstrap.sh
./Scripts/test.sh
~~~

Scripts/test.sh runs Swift package tests, app-model tests, and UI tests serially on iPhone 17 Pro Simulator.

The 2026-07-16 full serial gate passed 44 package tests, 2 app-model tests, and 4 UI tests.

Formatter gate:

~~~sh
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer \
  xcrun swift-format lint --configuration .swift-format --recursive \
  App Packages/SamadhiKit/Sources Packages/SamadhiKit/Tests Tests

## Coverage

Domain tests cover:

- Adaptive and fixed starts
- Stale cadence and timeout tokens
- Paused-time exclusion
- Resume reacquisition with cadence prior
- Permission fallback
- Route loss and explicit resume
- Finish visibility and hold identity
- Cancellation ordering
- VoiceOver control pinning
- Mixed summary metrics
- Track progress reset and configured collection wraparound
- Half-time and double-time tempo normalization
- Safe rate bounds, initial and ongoing ramps, deadband, and target update interval
- The 149.75 BPM focused fixture ramping from 1.00 through 0.98 and 0.96 toward a safe 142 SPM target
- Target recomputation when the track changes at a steady cadence
- Confidence hold, return to normal rate, and reacquisition reset
- Incompatible tracks and applied-rate match timing
- Honest tempo measurement and fixed-rhythm Not measured summary
- Stable cadence producing bounded, identified playback-rate effects
- Applied-rate feedback requiring current session, operation, request, and track identity
- Confidence loss holding the last rate, easing to 1.00, and returning to acquisition
- Stale session feedback and cadence-provider failure

Motion tests cover:

- The simulation and production provider boundary
- Five-observation stable lock
- Three-observation resume lock with the prior estimate as a smoothing seed
- Walking-range rejection, isolated spike rejection, and sustained missing cadence

The Core Motion adapter compiles for a generic iPhone target. A 29-second physical walk produced changing cadence and a 142 SPM average. Full placement calibration is not covered by this observation or automated tests.

Tempo-analysis tests cover:

- Periodic onset detection at 120, 150, 168, and 190 BPM
- Half and double tempo equivalence within 2 percent
- Alternating accents
- Strong every-third-beat accents reject instead of producing a confident triple-meter error
- Silence and irregular-onset rejection
- Mono and stereo audio-file decoding through the public analysis interface

These generated fixtures validate the module seam. The opt-in `TempoCorpusValidator` adds network evidence against 12 provider-hosted Apple previews whose catalog titles declare tempos from 130 through 180 BPM. Version 2 passed 12 of 12 within 2 percent of the reference or its half or double. No preview audio is committed, and normal tests remain offline.

UI tests cover:

- Complete golden run
- Motion permission recovery
- Audio route recovery
- Missing artwork

App-model tests cover ready mapping and start transition.

## Visual proof

Final frames under Evidence/Simulator/ cover ready, locked run, controls, summary, and Home Screen icon. Evidence/Previews/ covers accessibility text and state-specific visual checks.

## Truth boundary

Simulator verifies interaction, accessibility structure, reducer behavior, resource packaging, and deterministic motion. It cannot validate physical cadence quality, real headphone route behavior, tempo adaptation, or listening artifacts.

The `Samadhi MusicKit Gate` scheme verifies that the harness and framework calls compile. Physical traces separately prove authorization, library loading, automatic token generation, strict catalog resolution, preview decoding, playback, mechanical rate writes, pause, and resume. Bluetooth listening, background, controlled interruption, and route checks remain separate physical gates.

## Current device checks

- Unsigned generic iPhone build: passed
- Signed generic and physical iPhone builds: passed
- Physical iPhone installation and gate launch: passed
- Normal Simulator app: launched and visually checked
- MusicKit harness Simulator app: launched and visually checked
- Background audio entry in built Info.plist: verified as an array containing `audio`
- Physical device signing, build, installation, and launch: passed
- Focused body-to-music exact-profile build, installation, and launch argument: passed
- Physical cadence seam: passed for a 29-second walk with changing cadence and a 142 SPM average
- Automatic cadence-driven rate response: passed; the corrected 59-second physical run averaged 155 SPM and measured 98 percent tempo matched from MusicKit read-back
- Focused rate diagnostics: target, pending feedback, and MusicKit read-back are shown separately; commanded values are no longer echoed as applied
- Contextual Music authorization and 40-playlist loading: passed
- Real playback plus 0.94, 1.00, and 1.06 rate writes: passed mechanically
- Pause and resume observation: passed
- Direct library preview coverage: failed at 0 of 10 in every sample
- ISRC catalog retry: blocked because all 40 sampled tracks omitted ISRC
- Exact-App-ID signing: passed with `Samadhi Development` and application identifier `ZL5U59XBJ6.com.samaydhawan.Samadhi`
- Automatic developer token: passed with repeated direct catalog responses
- Strict catalog resolution: passed for 10 of 10 City Pocket tracks with 0.0-second duration deltas
- Temporary preview download and PCM decode: passed for 10 of 10 City Pocket tracks
- Built-in-speaker listening: passed provisionally; no major pitch change or unpleasant artifacts were reported at 0.94 and 1.06
- Bluetooth A2DP route: passed on Beoplay Eleven
- Bluetooth rate writes during playback: passed at 0.94, 1.00, and 1.06
- Bluetooth listening note: not recorded
- Spotify adaptive playback: rejected by documented platform capability and policy review; no code spike warranted
- Screen-lock background, next track, controlled interruption, and route-loss checks: deferred to the reliability gate

## Next implementation gate

Build playlist import and persistence, then analyze at least three selected tracks through the existing local analyzer. Connect real progress and transitions without changing the normal app's visual language. Before Milestone 2 completion, record one concise Bluetooth listening note and prove five screen-locked minutes, next track, controlled interruption, and route loss.

## Known environment behavior

iOS 27 beta Simulator can terminate concurrent UI test runners. Test script disables parallel execution. Serial suite is required gate.
