# Verification

## Full gate

~~~sh
./Scripts/bootstrap.sh
./Scripts/test.sh
~~~

Scripts/test.sh runs Swift package tests, app-model tests, and UI tests serially on iPhone 17 Pro Simulator.

The 2026-07-16 full gate passed 32 Swift package tests, 2 app-model tests, and 4 UI tests. The added coverage proves identified playback progress, preparation failure, and the deterministic player contract.

Formatter gate:

~~~sh
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer \
  xcrun swift-format lint --configuration .swift-format --recursive \
  App Packages/SamadhiKit/Sources Packages/SamadhiKit/Tests Tests
~~~

## Coverage

Domain tests cover:

- Adaptive and fixed starts
- Stale cadence and timeout tokens
- Paused-time exclusion
- Resume reacquisition with cadence prior
- Permission fallback
- Route loss and explicit resume
- Finish visibility and hold identity
- Cancellation ordering
- VoiceOver control pinning
- Mixed summary metrics
- Track progress reset and configured collection wraparound
- Half-time and double-time tempo normalization
- Safe rate bounds, initial and ongoing ramps, deadband, and target update interval
- Target recomputation when the track changes at a steady cadence
- Confidence hold, return to normal rate, and reacquisition reset
- Incompatible tracks and applied-rate match timing
- Honest tempo measurement and fixed-rhythm Not measured summary

Motion tests cover:

- The simulation and production provider boundary
- Five-observation stable lock
- Three-observation resume lock with the prior estimate as a smoothing seed
- Walking-range rejection, isolated spike rejection, and sustained missing cadence

The Core Motion adapter compiles for a generic iPhone target. Its sensor quality is not covered by automated tests.

UI tests cover:

- Complete golden run
- Motion permission recovery
- Audio route recovery
- Missing artwork

App-model tests cover ready mapping and start transition.

## Visual proof

Final frames under Evidence/Simulator/ cover ready, locked run, controls, summary, and Home Screen icon. Evidence/Previews/ covers accessibility text and state-specific visual checks.

## Truth boundary

Simulator verifies interaction, accessibility structure, reducer behavior, resource packaging, and deterministic motion. It cannot validate physical cadence quality, real headphone route behavior, tempo adaptation, or listening artifacts.

The `Samadhi MusicKit Gate` scheme verifies that the harness and framework calls compile. Physical traces separately prove authorization, library loading, automatic token generation, strict catalog resolution, preview decoding, playback, mechanical rate writes, pause, and resume. Bluetooth listening, background, controlled interruption, and route checks remain separate physical gates.

## Current device checks

- Unsigned generic iPhone build: passed
- Signed generic and physical iPhone builds: passed
- Physical iPhone installation and gate launch: passed
- Normal Simulator app: launched and visually checked
- MusicKit harness Simulator app: launched and visually checked
- Background audio entry in built Info.plist: verified as an array containing `audio`
- Physical device signing, build, installation, and launch: passed
- Contextual Music authorization and 40-playlist loading: passed
- Real playback plus 0.94, 1.00, and 1.06 rate writes: passed mechanically
- Pause and resume observation: passed
- Direct library preview coverage: failed at 0 of 10 in every sample
- ISRC catalog retry: blocked because all 40 sampled tracks omitted ISRC
- Exact-App-ID signing: passed with `Samadhi Development` and application identifier `ZL5U59XBJ6.com.samaydhawan.Samadhi`
- Automatic developer token: passed with repeated direct catalog responses
- Strict catalog resolution: passed for 10 of 10 City Pocket tracks with 0.0-second duration deltas
- Temporary preview download and PCM decode: passed for 10 of 10 City Pocket tracks
- Built-in-speaker listening: passed provisionally; no major pitch change or unpleasant artifacts were reported at 0.94 and 1.06
- Bluetooth A2DP route: passed on Beoplay Eleven
- Bluetooth rate writes during playback: passed at 0.94, 1.00, and 1.06
- Bluetooth listening note: not recorded
- Spotify adaptive playback: rejected by documented platform capability and policy review; no code spike warranted
- Screen-lock background, next track, controlled interruption, and route-loss checks: deferred to the reliability gate

## Next source gate

Run one verified-tempo catalog track through the production adapter, then connect Core Motion and the adaptation policy. Before Milestone 2 completion, record a concise Bluetooth listening note and prove five screen-locked minutes, next track, controlled interruption, and route loss.

## Known environment behavior

iOS 27 beta Simulator can terminate concurrent UI test runners. Test script disables parallel execution. Serial suite is required gate.
