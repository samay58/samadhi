# Decisions

## iOS 26 target

Use iOS 26 for personal prototype. One platform language is worth narrower compatibility. Revisit only if public distribution becomes active goal.

## Reproducible project

Use XcodeGen. Generated project stays versioned and reviewable. XcodeGen remains development-only dependency.

## Simulation boundary

Milestone 1 uses deterministic cadence and beat timing. It does not link Core Motion or production audio frameworks. Simulator proves interaction, not physical quality.

## State architecture

Use pure reducer plus one main-actor presentation model. Avoid screen view models and boolean phase clusters.

## Native ambient surface

Use local MeshGradient, restrained contours, and tempo aperture. No generated video, hosted animation, or free-running visual loop. Native rendering stays sharp, state-aware, and interruptible.

## Depth through hierarchy

Use one visual owner. Reserve glass for controls. Use open typography and tonal washes for passive information. Persistent rings must communicate progress or cadence.

## Brand

Product name is Samadhi. “In step” remains lowercase cadence metric. Public tagline is “music in stride.”

Use compact interlocking ribbon icon on opaque parchment. In-app mark uses native ribbon drawing instead of square icon.

## Evidence

Simulator screenshots, preview states, test logs, and result summary prove current build. They do not prove physical cadence or listening quality.

## Documentation

Active truth lives in PRODUCT.md, STATUS.md, and PLAN.md. Architecture, decisions, testing, progress, and brand support those files. Superseded build handoff and completed prompt artifacts were removed; Git history preserves them.
